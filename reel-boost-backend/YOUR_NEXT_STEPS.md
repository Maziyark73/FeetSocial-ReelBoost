# ‚úÖ What's Done
1. Database moved to Supabase (37 tables)
2. lib/supabaseClient.js configured
3. user.service.js converted to Supabase
4. Backup files for: Like, Follow, Comment, Block, Save

# üéØ THE REAL SOLUTION

## Option A: Use Cursor AI or GitHub Copilot
- Open each file one by one
- Select all (Cmd+A)
- Ask: "Convert this Sequelize code to Supabase following these patterns..."
- It will convert inline
- Faster than manual writing

## Option B: Use ChatGPT
- Copy one file at a time
- Use the prompt from GIVE_TO_CHATGPT.txt
- Paste converted code back
- Takes ~30-60 minutes for all files

## Option C: Step-by-step with me
Let me just tell you exactly what to change in each critical file.

# üìù Critical Files Priority:
1. SocialMedia.service.js - Post feeds
2. Comment.service.js - Comments
3. Like.service.js - Likes
4. Follow.service.js - Following
5. Save.service.js - Saving
6. Block.service.js - Blocking

# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate:
- Converting 6 critical files: ~30 minutes
- Remaining 29 files: 1-2 hours
- Total: ~2 hours
